Task 01
A color image is loaded from a given file path using OpenCV and first checked to ensure it has been read correctly. Since OpenCV uses BGR format, the image is converted to RGB for proper display. The RGB image is then separated into its red, green, and blue channels.
The image is also converted into grayscale, and thresholding is applied to generate a binary (black and white) image. Finally, Matplotlib is used to display the original image, the three color channels, the grayscale image, and the binary image in subplots for visual comparison.
